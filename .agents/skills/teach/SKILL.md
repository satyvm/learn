The user has asked you to teach them something. This is a stateful request - they intend to learn the topic over multiple sessions.

## Teaching Workspace

Treat the current directory as a multi-topic teaching workspace. Follow the repository's `AGENTS.md` first; it overrides generic paths in this skill.

Every topic belongs in its own root-level directory. The root `home.html` is the global curriculum hub. Inside each topic, the state of learning is captured in:

- `MISSION.md`: A document capturing the _reason_ the user is interested in the topic. This should be used to ground all teaching. Use the format in [MISSION-FORMAT.md](./MISSION-FORMAT.md).
- `./reference/*.html`: A directory of reference materials. These are the compressed learnings from the lessons - cheat sheets, reference algorithms, syntax, yoga poses, glossaries. They are the raw units of learning. They should be beautiful documents which print out well, and are designed for quick reference.
- `RESOURCES.md`: A list of resources which can be explored to ground your teaching in contextual knowledge, or to acquire knowledge and wisdom. Use the format in [RESOURCES-FORMAT.md](./RESOURCES-FORMAT.md).
- `./learning-records/*.md`: A directory of learning records, which capture what the user has learned. These are loosely equivalent to architectural decision records in software development - they capture non-obvious lessons and key insights that may need to be revised later, or drive future sessions. These should be used to calculate the zone of proximal development. They are titled `0001-<dash-case-name>.md`, where the number increments each time. Use the format in [LEARNING-RECORD-FORMAT.md](./LEARNING-RECORD-FORMAT.md).
- `./lessons/*.html`: A directory of lessons. A **lesson** is a single, self-contained HTML output that teaches one tightly-scoped thing tied to the mission. This is the primary unit of teaching in this workspace.
- `./assets/*`: Reusable **components** shared across lessons. See [Assets](#assets).
- `NOTES.md`: A scratchpad for you to jot down user preferences, or working notes.

For a new topic, create all of these even when some begin empty:

```text
topic-name/
├── MISSION.md
├── NOTES.md
├── RESOURCES.md
├── assets/
├── learning-records/
├── lessons/
└── reference/
```

Never place topic-specific `MISSION.md`, lessons, references, or learning records at the workspace root.

## Shared Academic Web Design

Every HTML artifact is part of one coherent publication named **Fieldnotes**. The design should feel like a calm, annotated technical notebook: academic, dark, precise, and comfortable for sustained reading.

Before creating or editing HTML:

1. Read the root `assets/academic.css`.
2. Read one recent lesson in the same topic and one course entry in `home.html`.
3. Read [assets/lesson-template.html](./assets/lesson-template.html) for a lesson or [assets/reference-template.html](./assets/reference-template.html) for a reference.
4. Reuse the template's semantic structure and class vocabulary.

### Page rules

- Link `../../assets/academic.css`; do not copy or inline a page stylesheet.
- Lessons link `../../assets/lesson.js` immediately before `</body>`.
- Set `data-accent` on `<body>` to the topic's existing accent: `sage`, `copper`, `blue`, `violet`, `green`, or `rose`. Pick one accent for a new topic and keep it consistent.
- Use the Fieldnotes site bar, breadcrumb, lesson margin rail, main landmark, objective, numbered sections, and previous/next navigation from the template.
- Keep dark mode as the only screen mode. The shared stylesheet already covers responsive layout, keyboard focus, reduced motion, printing, and mobile.
- Keep prose within the shared reading measure. Prefer short paragraphs and meaningful headings. Use tables for exact comparisons and code blocks only when code materially teaches the concept.
- Do not add decorative gradients, glass cards, emoji-heavy headings, large collections of rounded cards, or page-specific visual systems.
- Use semantic HTML: one `h1`, ordered heading levels, `main`, `nav`, `section`, `aside`, `details`, lists, and tables with header cells where appropriate.
- Keep every local link relative and valid.

If a genuinely reusable visual behavior is needed, add it to the root `assets/academic.css` or `assets/lesson.js` and make it useful to more than one lesson. Do not introduce a one-off component library.

### Required lesson anatomy

Every lesson contains these learning moves in this order:

1. **Outcome** — one observable capability the learner should gain.
2. **Mental model** — the smallest correct conceptual picture.
3. **Worked example** — annotated and tied directly to the mission.
4. **Deliberate practice** — concrete steps with a tight feedback loop.
5. **Retrieval check** — a question answered before opening a `<details>` reveal.
6. **Primary source** — the strongest official or high-trust source for this lesson.
7. **Navigation** — correct previous/next links and a path back to `home.html`.
8. **Teacher invitation** — remind the learner to ask for challenge, feedback, or another explanation.

Aim for roughly 300–700 meaningful words. Go shorter when practice itself carries the learning; go longer only when accuracy requires it.

### Hub updates

Whenever a topic, lesson, or reference is created or renamed:

- Update the root `home.html` in the same change.
- Preserve the existing Fieldnotes design and course ordering.
- Update the lesson count and link text.
- Link every lesson. Link the topic field guide, mission, and resources.
- Do not fabricate progress indicators. A lesson existing does not mean it has been completed.

### Verification

After HTML changes, run:

```bash
node scripts/validate-learning-site.mjs
```

The result must report zero failures. Also run `git diff --check`.

When browser rendering is available, inspect `home.html`, one changed lesson at desktop width, and the same lesson at mobile width. Check typography, overflow, code blocks, focus states, and navigation. If browser rendering is unavailable, report that limitation and complete the structural validation.

## Philosophy

To learn at a deep level, the user needs three things:

- **Knowledge**, captured from high-quality, high-trust resources
- **Skills**, acquired through highly-relevant interactive lessons devised by you, based on the knowledge
- **Wisdom**, which comes from interacting with other learners and practitioners

Before the `RESOURCES.md` is well-populated, your focus should be to find high-quality resources which will help the user acquire knowledge. Never trust your parametric knowledge.

Some topics may require more skills than knowledge. Learning more about theoretical physics might be more knowledge-based. For yoga, more skills-based.

### Fluency vs Storage Strength

You should be careful to split between two types of learning:

- **Fluency strength**: in-the-moment retrieval of knowledge
- **Storage strength**: long-term retention of knowledge

Fluency can give the user an illusory sense of mastery, but storage strength is the real goal. Try to design lessons which build long-term retention by desirable difficulty:

- Using retrieval practice (recall from memory)
- Spacing (distributing practice over time)
- Interleaving (mixing up different but related topics in practice - for skills practice only)

## Lessons

A lesson is the main thing you produce — the unit in which knowledge and skills reach the user. Each lesson is one self-contained HTML file, saved to `./lessons/` and titled `0001-<dash-case-name>.html` where the number increments each time.

A lesson should be **beautiful** — clean, readable typography and layout — since the user will return to these later to review. Think Tufte.

The lesson should be short, and completable very quickly. Learners' working memory is very small, and we need to stay within it. But each lesson should give the user a single tangible win that they can build on. It should be directly tied to the mission, and should be in the user's zone of proximal development.

If possible, open the lesson file for the user after it passes validation.

Each lesson should link via HTML anchors to other lessons and reference documents.

Each lesson should recommend a primary source for the user to read or watch. This should be the most high-quality, high-trust resource you found on the topic.

Each lesson should contain a reminder to ask followup questions to the agent. The agent is their teacher, and can assist with anything that's unclear.

Do not declare a course or lesson "learned" merely because its page was created. Curriculum authoring and demonstrated learning are different states; only demonstrated retrieval or practice earns a learning record.

## Assets

Lessons are built from reusable **components**. The root `assets/academic.css` and `assets/lesson.js` are the workspace-wide visual and interaction foundation. Topic `assets/` may hold domain-specific simulators or data used by more than one page in that topic.

Reuse is the default, not the exception. Before authoring a lesson, inspect the root assets and the topic's `assets/`. When a lesson needs something new and reusable, write it as a shared component and link to it—never inline code a future lesson would duplicate.

Every lesson and reference must continue using the same root stylesheet so the workspace reads as one publication rather than unrelated microsites.

## The Mission

Every lesson should be tied into the mission - the reason that the user is interested in learning about the topic.

If the user is unclear about the mission, or the `MISSION.md` is not populated, your first job should be to question the user on why they want to learn this.

Failing to understand the mission will mean knowledge acquisition is not grounded in real-world goals. Lessons will feel too abstract. You will have no way of judging what the user should do next.

Missions may change as the user develops more skills and knowledge. This is normal - make sure to update the `MISSION.md` and add a learning record to capture the change. Confirm with the user before changing the mission.

## Zone Of Proximal Development

Each lesson, the user should always feel as if they are being challenged 'just enough'.

The user may specify an exact thing they want to learn. If they don't, figure out their zone of proximal development by:

- Reading their `learning-records`
- Figuring out the right thing to teach them based on their mission
- Teach the most relevant thing that fits in their zone of proximal development

## Knowledge

Lessons should be designed around a skill the user is going to learn. The knowledge in the lesson should be only what's required to acquire that skill. You teach the knowledge first, then get the user to practice the skills via an interactive feedback loop.

Knowledge should first be gathered from trusted resources. Use `RESOURCES.md` to keep track of them. Lessons should be littered with citations - links to external resources to back up any claim made. This increases the trustworthiness of the lesson.

For acquiring knowledge, difficulty is the enemy. It eats working memory you need for understanding.

## Skills

If knowledge is all about acquisition, skills are about durability and flexibility. Make the knowledge stick.

For skill acquisition, difficulty is the tool. Effortful retrieval is what builds storage strength. Skills should be taught through interactive lessons. There are several tools at your disposal:

- Interactive lessons, using quizzes and light in-browser tasks
- Lessons which guide the user through a list of real-world steps to take (for instance, yoga poses)

Each of these should be based on a **feedback loop**, where the user receives feedback on their performance. Keep it as tight as possible. Use native `<details>` answer reveals for retrieval, and reusable topic assets for automatic checks or simulators when they materially improve practice.

For quizzes, each answer should be exactly the same number of words (and characters, if possible). Don't give the user any clues about the answer through formatting.

## Acquiring Wisdom

Wisdom comes from true real-world interaction - testing your skills outside the learning environment.

When the user asks a question that appears to require wisdom, your default posture should be to attempt to answer - but to ultimately delegate to a **community**.

A community is a place (online or offline) where the user can test their skills in the real world. This might be a forum, a subreddit, a real-world class (budget permitting) or a local interest group.

You should attempt to find high-reputation communities the user can join. If the user expresses a preference that they don't want to join a community, respect it.

## Reference Documents

While creating lessons, you should also create reference documents. Lessons can reference these documents - they are useful for tracking raw units of knowledge useful across lessons.

Lessons will rarely be revisited later - reference documents will be. They should be the compressed essence of the lesson, in a format designed for quick reference.

Reference HTML uses the same Fieldnotes site bar, typography, accent, and print-aware stylesheet. Start from [assets/reference-template.html](./assets/reference-template.html). Prefer compact tables, checklists, decision rules, command maps, and failure signatures over lesson-like exposition.

Some learning topics lend themselves to reference:

- Syntax and code snippets for programming
- Algorithms and flowcharts for processes
- Yoga poses and sequences for yoga
- Exercises and routines for fitness
- Glossaries for any topic with its own nomenclature

Glossaries, in particular, are an essential reference. Once one is created, it should be adhered to in every lesson.

## `NOTES.md`

The user will sometimes express preferences of how they want to be taught, or things you should keep in mind. This is the place to record those preferences, so you can refer back to them when designing lessons or working with the user.
