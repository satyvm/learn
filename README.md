# learn

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines SvelteKit, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **SvelteKit** - Web framework for building Svelte apps
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to see the web application.

## Deployment

### Docker Compose

- Target: web
- Config: `docker-compose.yml` (app Dockerfiles live in `apps/*/Dockerfile`)
- Build images: bun run docker:build
- Start: bun run docker:up
- Logs: bun run docker:logs
- Stop: bun run docker:down

Environment variables are read from each app's `.env` file (baked into web builds for public variables) and overridden in `docker-compose.yml` for container networking.

For more details, see the guide on [Deploying with Docker Compose](https://www.better-t-stack.dev/docs/guides/docker).
